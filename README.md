# Philip's University Projects 

## 1) project_1_covid.sql (SQL Run through)

Simple data manipulation and wrangling using SQL
- Used simple SQL functions
- Used aggregate functions
- Used CTE
- Used temp tables
- created views

## 2) PYTHON_SQL_CW.ipynb (Basics/Introduction)

This project required given data to be: Cleaned, Formatted, Stored and Modified.
- Renamed Columns.
- Dealt with missing values.
- Removed Duplicates.
- Standardised Columns.
- Stored Cleaned Databases' in SQL.
- Used random integers to select rows to modify.
- Mainly used pandas and numpy to resolve issues, some functions made.

## 3) rstudio_statics.pdf (Statistical Analysis and Visualisation using R)
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Regression
- Poisson Model
- Created Histograms
- P-values and Likelihood ratios used
- Lasso and Logistic Regression
- Fit Logistic model using glmnet
- Cross-validated models to select model
- ROC plotted to summarise findings
- Sensitivity and Specificity used as a function of a column and plotted to determine effectiveness of predictions

## 4) machine_learning_cw.pdf (Machine Learning task using python)
#### First Link/Task:
- Using absenteeism at work dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository developed machine learning pipeline to predict employee absenteeism.
- Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, sklearn
- Used Decision Tree, SVM and KNN models.
- Each model tuned using relevant paramters: decision tree used optimised alpha values, SVM with kernel changes, KNN with K.

#### Second Link/Task:
- Deep Learning for Image classification.
- Used existing convolutional neural network classifier to classify given images into classes.
